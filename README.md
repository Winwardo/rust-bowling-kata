# rust-bowling-kata

Solution in Rust to the [Bowling Kata](https://codingdojo.org/kata/Bowling/). As is idiomatic in Rust, unit tests are written in-line in `main.rs`
Note the lack of extra structs / traits. This Kata can be solved cleanly and simply with basic functions, whereas common solutions often overcomplicate early with a variety of Bowl, Pin or Set classes.
